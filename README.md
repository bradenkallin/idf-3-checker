# idf-3-checker
This script checks data against the IDF 3 standard for MCAD/ECAD data transfer. Not all features of the standard are implemented, as the script was written for a specific team of PCB Designers and Mechanical Engineers, all of whom use the same standardized processes and CAD tools.

This script is written for Python 3.5 and its standard library.
